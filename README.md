# OIBSIP_Datascience_Task2
This is **Task 2** of my **AICTE – Oasis Infobyte Virtual Internship**, focused on analyzing how unemployment trends in India were affected during the COVID-19 pandemic using real-world data.

#Project Overview

This project analyzes unemployment data across Indian states over several months during the COVID-19 period. The aim is to identify how drastically employment was affected and to visualize key labor metrics such as:

- **Unemployment Rate (%)**
- **Labour Participation Rate (%)**
- **Estimated Employed Population**

The analysis helps understand the **economic impact of the COVID-19 lockdowns** on the Indian workforce.
#Dataset Description

The dataset includes:
- Monthly data (mostly from 2020)
- State-wise labor statistics
- Fields such as:
  - `Estimated Employed`
  - `Unemployment Rate`
  - `Labour Participation Rate`
  - `Region`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`
#Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning & manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numeric operations
- **Matplotlib** – Basic plotting
- **Seaborn** – Statistical visualizations

#Analysis Highlights

- Plotted **unemployment rate trends over time**
- Visualized **state-wise variations**
- Identified the **sharp rise in unemployment in April–June 2020**, coinciding with national lockdowns
- Highlighted regional differences in recovery trends
#Key Learnings

This task helped me understand:
- How to work with **real-world economic datasets**
- The use of **data visualization** in conveying key insights
- Basic **time series and categorical analysis**
- The real-life impact of a global crisis on a country’s labor economy
